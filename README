===========

This is an exercise project in git, Scala, PlayFramework, Bootstrap, Google+ integration and Heroku.
It implements a system for collecting football match outcome forecasts in order to generate and calculate a betting slip to a majority preference.
Google plus integration will allow users to exercise their bragging rights, or to swear, curse or insult others on their bad forecast or overall score.
Also the system will track groups betting account balance .. etc.
Nothing special, so if you expected something extraordinary, move along :)
